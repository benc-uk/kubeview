# Contributing Guidance
Hello! Thanks for taking an interest in my project/repo.

Contributions to this project are welcome of course, otherwise I wouldn't have put it on GitHub ðŸ˜ƒ however there's a few things I'd like to point out:

- This is a personal project, it is not maintained by a team or group.
- The code here is not production grade, you won't see many unit tests or other 'robust' practices in the code base.
- I might have written things a certain way either by ignorance of a better/faster/cooler approach, maybe by design or just simple pragmatism.
- It might take me a long time (weeks) to reply to issues or review PRs, I have a day job & I might not have looked at the code for a while.

A few pointers

- If you're thinking of adding a feature via a PR please create an issue first and we can discuss it.
- Please keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or change, with discreet commits. Multiple PRs if need be.

Thanks!
